# Machine Learning Classifier for Sorting Lego Pieces

## Description
This project focuses on developing and training a machine learning model for image-based classification of four Lego categories. The system utilizes **Python** and **Logistic Regression** to classify Lego pieces based on shape using image preprocessing techniques.

## Project Status
- **Stage 1**: Completed.

## Key Features
- Image preprocessing with **grayscale conversion** and **cropping** for improved classification accuracy.
- Model training using **Logistic Regression** with high accuracy on training and test data.
- Achieved **97.2% accuracy** on test data, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.
